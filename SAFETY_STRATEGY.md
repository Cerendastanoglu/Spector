# Spector Git Safety Strategy

## Primary Goal: **Never Lose Development Work**

### Simple Safety-First Approach

#### Core Branches
- **`main`** - Stable baseline (basic structure only)
- **`develop`** - **Your working branch** - where all development happens
- **`backup-YYYY-MM-DD`** - Daily safety snapshots

#### Safety Workflow

### 1. **Daily Safety Commits**
Every day before major changes:
```bash
# Save current progress
git add .
git commit -m "Daily progress: [what you worked on]"

# Create safety backup branch
git checkout -b backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
git checkout develop
```

### 2. **Before Major Changes**
Before any significant edits:
```bash
# Create checkpoint
git add .
git commit -m "Checkpoint before: [what you're about to do]"

# Optional: Create named backup
git checkout -b backup-before-[change-description]
git checkout develop
```

### 3. **Recovery Strategy**
If something goes wrong:
```bash
# See all your backups
git branch --list "backup-*"

# Restore from any backup
git checkout backup-2025-09-12
git checkout -b recover-work
```

## Current Status Protection

### What We Have Now (All Working ✅)
- ✅ Brand colors implemented (#FF204E, #A0153E, #5D0E41, #00224D)
- ✅ Modern welcome page with pricing cards
- ✅ Analytics dashboard with real Shopify data
- ✅ Updated header with new colors and logo
- ✅ Documentation (BRAND_COLORS.md, GIT_STRATEGY.md)

### Immediate Safety Actions
1. **Commit current work** to `develop` branch 
2. **Create first backup** before next changes
3. **Never work directly on main**

## Simple Rules for Safety
1. **Always commit before major changes**
2. **Create backup branches for important milestones** 
3. **Never delete branches** (disk space is cheap, lost work is expensive)
4. **Use descriptive commit messages**
5. **Push to remote regularly** (if you have one set up)

## Recovery Commands (Keep These Handy)
```bash
# See what changed
git status
git diff

# Undo last commit (but keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo changes to a file  
git checkout HEAD -- filename

# See all branches (including backups)
git branch -a

# Go back to any previous state
git checkout [branch-name]
git checkout -b new-branch-from-backup
```

## Next Steps
1. Commit current progress to `develop`
2. Create first backup branch
3. Continue development safely on `develop` branch
