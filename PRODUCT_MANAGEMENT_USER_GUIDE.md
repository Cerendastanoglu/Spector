## ⚠️ Important Tips & Warnings

### ✋ Before You Click "Apply" or "Update":

1. **DOUBLE-CHECK YOUR SELECTION**
   - Look at the thumbnails of selected products
   - Make sure you selected the RIGHT products!
   - Use filters to narrow down first if needed

2. **PRICE CHANGES ARE IMMEDIATE**
   - Once you click "Apply Price Changes", it happens instantly
   - There's no undo button!
   - Start with a small test if you're unsure

3. **"REPLACE" MEANS DELETE OLD STUFF**
   - In Tags: "Replace" deletes ALL old tags
   - In Titles/Descriptions: "Set All" or "Replace" removes old content
   - Use "Add Prefix/Suffix" if you want to keep existing text!

4. **VARIANTS = MULTIPLE UPDATES**
   - If a product has 5 sizes (variants), you're updating all 5
   - The variant count tells you how many individual items you're changing

5. **INVENTORY METHOD MATTERS**
   - "Set to" = Exact number (ignores current stock)
   - "Add" = Adds to current stock
   - "Remove" = Subtracts from current stock
   - Choose carefully!

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "I don't see any products!"
- Check your filters - you might be filtering out everything
- Click "All Products" to reset filters
- Try clicking "Select All" to see if products appear

### "The operation didn't work!"
- Make sure you clicked the final "Apply" or "Update" button
- Check for error messages at the top (red notifications)
- Verify you selected products in Step 1
- Make sure you filled in all required fields (marked with *)

### "I changed the wrong products!"
- Go to each product manually to fix
- Or: Select those products again and update them back
- Unfortunately, there's no undo button - be careful!

### "My percentage calculation seems wrong"
- Example: 10% increase on $20 = $22 (20 × 1.10)
- Example: 15% decrease on $20 = $17 (20 × 0.85)
- Check your math or try a small test first!
