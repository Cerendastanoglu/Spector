  # NOTE: GDPR webhooks (customers/data_request, customers/redact, shop/redact)
  # CANNOT be added via shopify.app.toml - Shopify blocks automated registration.
  # These webhooks are automatically registered by Shopify when you:
  # 1. Request "Protected customer data access" in Partner Dashboard
  # 2. Get approved (usually 1-3 business days)
  # 3. Shopify will automatically create these webhook subscriptions
  # Your webhook handlers are already implemented and will verify HMAC correctly.
